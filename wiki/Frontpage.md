I'm delighted to see you! Please feel free to look around.
There is section called Getting Started which might be most
relevant if you are not experienced with any Lisp-derivative.
If you are, I would advise you to have a look at the more "advanced"
topics, such as IO or the Advanced Features Already Implemented page.

If you want to contribute, please look at the Contributing page or
the Advanced Features page that I already mentioned. *Have fun!*

If you run into trouble at any time, feel free to contact me by
any means necessary that do not involve breaking my door.
