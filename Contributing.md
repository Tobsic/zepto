# Contributing

If you consider contributing to zepto, please take the time to
read through this Code of Conduct first. It is concise and emphasizes
freedom and equality and we hope that is pleasant to you. It was written
by the [core maintainer of zepto](mailto:veit@veitheller.de) and is not
actively based on existing CoCs. If you feel like this document is
deficient in one way or another, do not hesitate to contact the author.

# Developer Code of Conduct

1. Respect other people's opinions and listen to them.
2. Everyone can work on whatever they want, no matter what their professional and personal background is.
   If you are more experienced in a particular field than the person next to you, try to guide them.
   Your contributions are not worth more or less because of your background; they should be able to
   stand on their own.
3. All views expressed by anyone are to be treated as opinion, not fact or guidelines (other than this
   document).
4. Everyone should feel welcome. If they do not, consider this a bug we need to fix.
5. Not everyone can be helpful at all times. Respect their personality; if they do not seem like a
   nice person to you, try to get help elsewhere. If they are threatening, however, that is a bug as
   well and we need to try to resolve this in one way or another.
6. If you do not know how to resolve a conflict, the core developers and maintainers are there to help.
   Try to resolve matters of private and/or personal nature in a private and personal conversation first.
   If this does not solve the conflict, contact one of the maintainers. Try to refrain from escalation
   of the conflict into the public space if possible, but do not hesitate to seek help if you feel like
   you need it.

In short, don't be an ass and don't tolerate assholery.
